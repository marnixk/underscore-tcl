# Underscore TCL

As part of getting to know the Tcl programming language I've created a simple port of the underscorejs library that I'm accustomed to working with. This will make it easier to manipulate lists and arrays in ways I'll understand. 

All functions live in the _ (`underscore`) namespace.
